# Stress-Detection using machine learning
# üß† Project Overview
EEG-Based Anxiety Detection Using GRU Deep Learning Model for Real-Time Monitoring
Mental health has become an increasingly important aspect of life, especially in today's fast-paced and high-pressure environments. Stress and anxiety, if left undetected, can lead to long-term mental and physical health complications. This project focuses on leveraging Electroencephalogram (EEG) data and physiological signals to detect stress in real time using GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) deep learning models.

This project is personally meaningful to me, as I have experienced stress during academic situations like exams, results announcements, and personal circumstances. These experiences motivated me to explore how technology can help in early detection and intervention of stress to promote mental well-being.

# üéØ Project Objective
The primary goal of this project is to:

Detect and classify human emotional states (e.g., anxiety, neutral, happy)
Predict early signs of stress using physiological inputs
Provide real-time feedback with stress-relief suggestions
Enable practical applications in healthcare, education, and daily life

# üìà Key Features
Real-time monitoring of stress levels
Uses publicly available WESAD dataset
Based on physiological and EEG data
GRU-based deep learning model for accurate classification
Custom recommendations for stress reduction
Highly applicable in mental health tech solutions

# ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
1. Dataset Description: WESAD
We used the WESAD (Wearable Stress and Affect Detection) dataset, which is a well-known multi-modal dataset for emotion and stress detection.
It includes various physiological data signals collected via wearable devices such as chest and wrist sensors.
Features used in our project include:

Heart Rate (HR)
Galvanic Skin Response (GSR)
Eye Blink Frequency
Blood Pressure
Lack of Sleep Indicators
EEG signals from scalp electrodes

# 2. Data Acquisition through EEG & FFT
EEG sensors are used to capture electrical activity of the brain through electrodes placed on the scalp.
These raw EEG signals are then passed through Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to convert them into a frequency domain, helping to isolate stress-related patterns.

# 3. Data Preprocessing
Cleaning the data to remove noise, null values, and missing values
Normalization and standardization to maintain consistency
Segmenting signals into time windows for input into the model

# 4. Feature Extraction
Extracted features such as:
Frequency bands (Alpha, Beta, Theta)

Heart rate variability
Skin conductance peaks
Blink interval statistics
lack of sleeplesness
blood pressure
These features provide strong indicators of the user‚Äôs mental state

# 5. Model Architecture ‚Äì GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)
Chosen because of its strength in handling sequential and time-series data, such as EEG signals
GRU model processes temporal patterns in data to classify emotional states
The model outputs one of the following labels:

Anxious
Neutral
Happy

# 6. Real-Time Monitoring and Prediction
The system can continuously monitor input from EEG and physiological signals
Predicts current emotional state and updates in real-time
Suitable for integration with wearable devices or mobile applications

# Preventive Suggestions

If stress is detected, the system suggests ways to reduce it, such as:
Going for a walk
Practicing deep breathing
Meditation
Chatting with friends
Taking short breaks
It early predicts stress so that long term diseases like anxiety and depression related issues can be stopped at early stage.

# üí° Applications
Healthcare: Continuous monitoring of patients' stress levels for early intervention
Education: Detecting stress in students during exams or academic pressure
Workplace: Monitoring mental wellness in high-pressure jobs
Mental Health Platforms: Building smarter, AI-powered mental health assistants


# üìå Why This Project Matters
Mental health disorders affect 1 in 4 people globally.
Real-time detection and intervention can save lives and improve quality of life.
This system demonstrates how AI and biomedical signals can be combined for a social cause.
It encourages the adoption of tech-powered self-care solutions.



# üîó Future Scope and Enhancements
This project lays the foundation for intelligent stress detection using deep learning. In the future, it can be enhanced further through:

üß† Integration with IoT (Internet of Things)
Real-time Monitoring Devices: By integrating IoT-enabled biosensors (like EEG headsets, pulse oximeters, GSR sensors), the system can collect live data from users.
Edge Computing: With lightweight models, inference can be done on edge devices such as Raspberry Pi or microcontrollers.
Cloud-Based Analytics: Collected data can be sent to the cloud for deeper analysis, trend tracking, and healthcare record storage.

‚åö Applications in Wearable Devices
Stress detection can be embedded into smartwatches, fitness bands, or headbands that already monitor heart rate, sleep, and activity.
These wearables can give instant feedback and alerts when high stress is detected, along with suggested relaxation activities.

üì± Smartphone Integration
A companion mobile app can be developed to visualize the user's mental health trends over time.

The app can also deliver:
Real-time alerts and suggestions
Breathing exercises or guided meditations
Chatbots or journaling features
Emergency contact notifications in critical stress situations
